## OVERVIEW
For this project, I was tasked to transform a figma design to code without any library.
This is the image of the design.

## Task 0 

### Read and be familiar with Figma 
For this task, I was given access to the figma file and the fonts. Two fonts were shared for this project and I choose to use [source-sans-pro](/source-sans-pro/).

For this task, I created a repository called **headphones** and it contaied a README.md file.

## Task 1

### Header

For this task, I was asked to create the header of the design. I created the HTML of the header, then the CSS variables of all sections before moving to implementing the styles.

I first created the mobile view before moving to create the tablet and desktop view.

### Outcome of task 1

Here is how the it looks like:
#### Mobile view

#### Tablet view:

#### Desktop view:

## Task 2

### "What we do..." section 
To create the 'what we do' section, I first copied the previous index.html and styles.css files. I implemented the design in the same format as the previous; the mobile view, then the tablet and desktop view.

### Outcome of task 2

#### Mobile view

### Outcome of task 3

## What I learned
I learned how to implement designs into code and make them responsive. I also learned how to open figma designs on visual studio code and how to use grid and flexbox together.
